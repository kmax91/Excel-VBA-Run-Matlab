# Excel-VBA-Run-Matlab

There are two buttons in this file.

Button 1 get the list of all matlab files present in the current folder.  
Button 2 runs each of the files.  

**Warnings  
1): If you are running too many .m files, keep an eye on the Disk Utilization of your computer.  
2): In order to save time, the Matlab GIU is not launched. However, you should be able to see all charts the are created within your .m file.


# FAQs  

1. Do I need to make any changes in the .m files?
-> I would recommend that you save all the results(datasets and charts) to files to that you can view them later.

2. I see a warning when I open the file. Is this dangerous?
-> Typically, it is unsafe to launch an xlsm file if you don't know what's in it. But if you feel unsafe while opening my file, feel free to explore the VBA code. (alt-F11)

3. What would be the ideal application of this excel file?
-> If you have many different files to run and don't feel like opening each file and hitting the run button, this file would be your best friend.
